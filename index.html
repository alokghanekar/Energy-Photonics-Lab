    <h1>Energy Photonics Lab </h1>
    <p>Our research focuses on nanostructured materials and their interactions with infrared thermal radiation. We design these materials to control and tune their thermal emission properties, enabling applications in energy harvesting, infrared detection, and thermal camouflage for defense purposes.
The main thrust of our current work involves active metasurfaces—engineered materials whose thermal radiative properties can be dynamically modulated in real time. We view thermal radiation through the lens of light-matter interactions, uncovering various pathways to bend, squeeze, tailor, mold, twist, and ultimately harness the “thermal light” to serve functional and emergent technologies.</p>
